# Instuctions

If you are using the new GitHub app for Windows, right-click the repository with "local" selected on the left and choose "open shell here" to run all commands.

To clone:
1. Go to [you-KSP-foler-root]/saves
2. git clone https://github.com/daimoneze/ksp-myah.git . (the period at the end is important).

You now have the latest shared MYAH KSP Save.

Before you play, make sure to run "git pull" from the saves folder.
When you are done, do git commit -m "[commit message]". If you don't use the -m switch, git will try to open your default text editor so you can add a message.

After you commit, you should either do a another git pull in case some changes were made (not likely) followed by a git push, or simply skip to git push. The push will finally update the remote repository with your newly merged changes.
